           <header>What is HTML</header>
           <p>
              HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language.
              It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure
              the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as 
              the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements
              , which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content 
              to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make 
              content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and
               so on.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is
             a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) element:
         </p>
         <pre>
           <code>
            &lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;
          </code>
         </pre>
       </section>

       <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
        <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
        <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</p>
        <p>The anatomy of our element is: </p>
        <ul>
           <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph),
                wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins
                 or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
           </li>
           <li>The content: This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
           <li>The closing tag:  This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash 
               before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is
               a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>
        
        <h3>Nesting elements</h3>
        <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to
           state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a &lt;strong&gt; element, 
           which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
             &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy&lt;/p&gt;
           </code>
       </pre>
        <P>
           There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the p 
           element first, then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the
           strong element first, before closing the p.
        </P>
        <p>The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:</p>
        <pre class="wrong">
            <code>
             &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
           </code>
       </pre>
       <p>
        The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. 
        With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. 
        This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.
       </p>
       <h3>Block versus inline elements</h3>
       <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.</p>
       <ul>
         <li>
             Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following
             the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. 
             Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might 
             represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested
             inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.
        </li>
         <li>
             Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the documentâ€™s
             content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear
             in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an <a> element creates a hyperlink, and elements 
             such as &lt;em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt; create emphasis.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>Consider the following example:</p>
       <pre>
        <code>
         &lt;em&gt;first &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;second &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fifth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sixth&lt;/p&gt;
       </code>
      </pre>
       
      <p>
         &lt;em&gt;is an inline element. As you see below, the first three elements sit on the same line, with no space
         in between. On the other hand, &lt;p&gt; is a block-level element. Each p element appears on a new line, with space
         above and below. (The spacing is due to default CSS styling that the browser applies to paragraphs.)  
      </p>
       </section>

       <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
        <header>Attributes</header>
        <p>
           Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the
           class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.
        </p>
        <p>An attribute should have:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
              A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should
              be separated by spaces too.)
         </li>
          <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
          <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Boolean attributes</h3>
        <p>
           Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. These are called Boolean 
           attributes. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name. For 
           example, consider the disabled attribute, which you can assign to form input elements. (You use this to disable 
           the form input elements so the user can't make entries. The disabled elements typically have a grayed-out 
           appearance.) For example:
       </p>
       <pre>
        <code>
         &lt;input type="text" disabled="disabled"&gt;
       </code>
      </pre>
    </section>
      
    <section class="main-section" id="HTML_comments">
        <header>HTML comments</header>
        <P>
           HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments
           invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your
           logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough that you
           don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making changes and 
           updates.
        </P>

        <P>To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers &lt;!-- and --&gt;. For example:</P>
        <pre>
            <code>
             &lt;p&gt;I'm not inside a comment&lt;/p&gt;

             &lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;I am!&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;
           </code>
          </pre>
    </section>

       <section class="main-section" id="Summary">
        <header>Summary</header>
        <p>You made it to the end of the article! We hope you enjoyed your tour of the basics of HTML.</p>
        <p>
           At this point, you should understand what HTML looks like, and how it works at a basic level.
           You should also be able to write a few elements and attributes. The subsequent articles of 
           this module go further on some of the topics introduced here, as well as presenting other 
           concepts of the language.
